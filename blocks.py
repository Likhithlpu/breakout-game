    Represents an array of blocks in the game.

    Attributes:
    - screen: The game screen where the blocks will be drawn.
    - num_blocks: The number of blocks in each line.
    - lines: The number of lines of blocks.
    - block_width: The width of each block.
    - block_height: The height of each block.
    - block_spacing: The spacing between blocks.
    - blocks: A list to store the positions and colors of the blocks.
    - n: The current number of blocks.
    - SPRITES: A list of block sprites.
    - total: The total number of blocks.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, screen, num_blocks, lines, block_width=55, block_height=35, block_spacing=5): Initializes the BlockArray object.
    - initialize_block_pos(self): Initializes the positions of the blocks.
    - draw_blocks(self): Draws the blocks on the screen.
    - update(self, ball): Updates the state of the blocks based on the ball's position.
    - is_ball_colliding_with_block(self, ball, block_x, block_y): Checks if the ball is colliding with a block.
